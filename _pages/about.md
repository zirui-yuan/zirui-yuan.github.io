I am currently a final year master student at Tianjin University, supervised by Prof. [Minglai Shao](https://shaoml114.github.io/). My primary research interests lie in graph machine learning and artificial intelligence.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate.

I expect to graduate from Tianjin University in March 2024, and I am looking for a PhD position in 2024 Fall. Contact me if you have any leads!
