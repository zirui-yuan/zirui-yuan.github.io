I am a third-year master student at Tianjin University, guided by Prof. [Minglai Shao](https://shaoml114.github.io/). My primary research interest is in graph machine learning.
If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate.

I expect to graduate from Tianjin U in March 2024 and I am looking for PhD to start in 2024 Fall. Contact me if you have any leads!
